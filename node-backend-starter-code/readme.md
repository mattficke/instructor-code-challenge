Didn't get a chance to complete the full assignment (it's project week, which is taking up most of my time). And full disclosure, I picked the language I'm less comfortable with so this could serve as practice for our node lessons.

Doing this in vanilla javascript with no MVC framework was an interesting challenge! Makes me appreciate the tools we have access to.

## Issues
Not yet deployed to heroku. Need to look up using a nosql database, have only used postgres.

Favorites list doesn't filter by users.

Click events don't properly reset the page.

It's buggy as hell.
